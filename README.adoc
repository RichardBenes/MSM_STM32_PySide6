== MEMS chips used

MEMS chips present on the board:

* https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/l3gd20.html[L3GD20] -- 3-axis gyroscope
* https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm303c.html[LSM303C] -- compass + 3D accelerometer + 3D magnetometer
* https://www.st.com/en/audio-ics/mp34dt01-m.html[MP34DT01-M] -- MEMS microphone

== Plan & Progress

Next step:

* load program to L476
* update used OpenOCD

Overal progress

. Create & run PySide6 skeleton app ✔
. Create & run STM32 skeleton app (read buttons & blink LEDs) ✔
. Send data over UART to PC ✔
** Let's just copy the code from BP, there's no time for reading reference manuals now... well, there's none. Let's do it then. How long will it take?
. Read & show the data using PySide6 app
. Read data from the gyroscope
. Visualize the data (in any way) in the PySide6 app
. Create schematic for the project
. Find some good way of visualizing gyroscope data with Matplotlib, using 3D plots

== Ideas & Wonderings

* How to make `QLabel` background e.g. white? It's something with stylesheets
* Are CubeMX's projects made for Make usable? Is Make usable on Windows (MSYS?) without WSL?
* Are CubeIDE's C++ projects usable?
* What exactly are `.d`, `.o`, `.su` and `.cyclo` files? How can I read them?
* What _exactly_ is UART idle frame? Is it just "nothing happens" on the line for the duration of 1 frame?
* What is the difference between `stdint.h` and `stding-gcc.h`?
* `const` in C - what exactly does it mean? Especially in the context of pointers...
* Any good alternative to PuTTY?
* Let's go through the various embeddable scripting language interpretters and asses their usability for STM32's Cortex-M MCUs...
* Can I split file in Eclipse as I can in VS Code?
* How can I easily, interactively and offline try out various `printf()` formattings in C? Jupyter?
